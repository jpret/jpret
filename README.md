# 👋 Hi, I'm Jan Gabriel Pretorius  
I help systems stay **reliable, observable, and scalable** in mission-critical environments.

## 🚀 About Me  
- I'm passionate about **reliability, observability, and automation** in distributed systems.  
- I have experience in **air-gapped, high-security environments** and **cloud-native architectures**.  
- I advocate for using a **structured systems design** when building things and **continuous improvement** through postmortems and RCA.
